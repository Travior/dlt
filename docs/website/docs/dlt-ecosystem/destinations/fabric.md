# Microsoft Fabric Warehouse

## Install dlt with Fabric
**To install the dlt library with Fabric Warehouse dependencies, use:**
```sh
pip install "dlt[fabric]"
```

This will install `dlt` with the `mssql` extra, which contains all the dependencies required by the SQL Server client that Fabric uses.

<!--@@@DLT_DESTINATION_CAPABILITIES fabric-->

## Setup guide

### Prerequisites

`dlt[fabric]` installs Microsoft's [`mssql-python`](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-python) driver (version 1.13.0 or newer), which manages its SQL Server driver dependency. No separate Microsoft ODBC driver installation is needed for dlt SQL connections. Follow the driver's installation instructions for any platform-specific system libraries.

### Service Principal Authentication

Fabric Warehouse requires Azure Active Directory Service Principal authentication. You'll need:

1. **Tenant ID**: Your Azure AD tenant ID (GUID)
2. **Client ID**: Application (service principal) client ID (GUID)
3. **Client Secret**: Application client secret
4. **Host**: Your Fabric warehouse SQL endpoint
5. **Database**: The database name within your warehouse

**Finding your SQL endpoint:**
- In the Fabric portal, go to your warehouse **Settings**
- Select **SQL endpoint**
- Copy the **SQL connection string** - it should be in the format: `<guid>.datawarehouse.fabric.microsoft.com`

### Create a pipeline

**1. Initialize a project with a pipeline that loads to Fabric by running:**
```sh
dlt init chess fabric
```

**2. Install the necessary dependencies for Fabric by running:**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or run:
```sh
pip install "dlt[fabric]"
```

**3. Enter your credentials into `.dlt/secrets.toml`.**

```toml
[destination.fabric.credentials]
host = "<your-warehouse-guid>.datawarehouse.fabric.microsoft.com"
database = "mydb"
azure_tenant_id = "your-azure-tenant-id"
azure_client_id = "your-client-id"
azure_client_secret = "your-client-secret"
port = 1433
connect_timeout = 30
```

## Write disposition
All write dispositions are supported, including the [`upsert`](../../general-usage/merge-loading.md#upsert-strategy) and [`insert-only`](../../general-usage/merge-loading.md#insert-only-strategy) merge strategies.

If you set the [`replace` strategy](../../general-usage/full-loading.md) to `staging-optimized`, the destination tables will be dropped and recreated with an `ALTER SCHEMA ... TRANSFER`. The operation is atomic: Fabric supports DDL transactions.

## Staging support

Fabric Warehouse supports staging data via **OneLake Lakehouse** or **Azure Blob / Data Lake Storage** using the `COPY INTO` command for efficient bulk loading. This is the recommended approach for large datasets.


### Examples

```py
import dlt

pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    destination="fabric",
    staging="filesystem",
    dataset_name='my_dataset'
)
```

#### `.dlt/secrets.toml` when using OneLake:

```toml
[destination.fabric.credentials]
# your fabric credentials

[destination.filesystem]
bucket_url = "abfss://<your-workspace-guid>@onelake.dfs.fabric.microsoft.com/<your-lakehouse-guid>/Files"

[destination.filesystem.credentials]
azure_storage_account_name = "onelake"
azure_account_host = "onelake.blob.fabric.microsoft.com"
# use same Service Principal credentials as in [destination.fabric.credentials]
azure_tenant_id = "your-tenant-id"
azure_client_id = "your-client-id"
azure_client_secret = "your-client-secret"
```

**Finding your GUIDs**:
1. Navigate to your Fabric workspace in the browser
2. The workspace GUID is in the URL: `https://fabric.microsoft.com/groups/<workspace_guid>/...`
3. Open your Lakehouse
4. The lakehouse GUID is in the URL: `https://fabric.microsoft.com/.../lakehouses/<lakehouse_guid>`

#### `.dlt/secrets.toml` when using Azure Blob / Data Lake Storage:

```toml
[destination.fabric.credentials]
# your fabric credentials

[destination.filesystem]
bucket_url = "az://your-container-name"

[destination.filesystem.credentials]
azure_storage_account_name = "your-storage-account-name"
azure_storage_account_key = "your-storage-account-key"
```

## Data loading
Data is loaded via INSERT statements by default. Fabric Warehouse has a limit of 1000 rows per INSERT, and this is what we use.

## Supported file formats
* [insert-values](../file-formats.md#sql-insert) is the default and currently only supported format

## Supported column hints
**fabric** will create unique indexes for all columns with `unique` hints. This behavior **is disabled by default**.

### Table and column identifiers
Fabric Warehouse (like SQL Server) uses **case-insensitive identifiers** but preserves the casing of identifiers stored in the INFORMATION SCHEMA. You can use [case-sensitive naming conventions](../../general-usage/naming-convention.md#case-sensitive-and-insensitive-destinations) to keep the identifier casing. Note that you risk generating identifier collisions, which are detected by `dlt` and will fail the load process.

## Syncing of `dlt` state
This destination fully supports [dlt state sync](../../general-usage/state#syncing-state-with-destination).

## Data types

Fabric Warehouse differs from standard SQL Server in several important ways:

### VARCHAR vs NVARCHAR
Fabric Warehouse uses `varchar` for text columns instead of `nvarchar`. Because `varchar` lengths are counted in
bytes while `precision` counts characters, the precision is multiplied by 4 (the worst case for UTF-8):
- `text` → `varchar(max)`
- `text` with `precision` → `varchar(precision * 4)`, for example `precision=25` → `varchar(100)`
- `text` with `precision` above 2000 → `varchar(max)`, since 8000 is the longest length Fabric accepts

### DATETIME2 vs DATETIMEOFFSET
Fabric uses `datetime2` for timestamps instead of `datetimeoffset`:
- `timestamp` → `datetime2(6)` (precision limited to 0-6, not 0-7)
- `time` → `time(6)` (explicit precision required)

### JSON Storage
Fabric does not support native JSON columns. JSON objects are stored as `varchar(max)` columns.

## Collation Support

Fabric Warehouse supports UTF-8 collations. The destination uses `mssql-python` for SQL connections; it does not send the unsupported `LongAsMax` keyword.

**Default collation**: `Latin1_General_100_BIN2_UTF8` (case-sensitive, UTF-8)

You can specify a different collation:
```toml
[destination.fabric]
collation = "Latin1_General_100_CI_AS_KS_WS_SC_UTF8"  # case-insensitive
```

Or in code:
```py
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    destination=fabric(
        credentials=my_credentials,
        collation="Latin1_General_100_CI_AS_KS_WS_SC_UTF8"
    )
)
```

## Additional destination options

The **fabric** destination **does not** create UNIQUE indexes by default on columns with the `unique` hint (i.e., `_dlt_id`). To enable this behavior:
```toml
[destination.fabric]
create_indexes=true
```

The SQL driver is managed by `mssql-python`; there is no ODBC driver name to configure.

## Differences from MSSQL Destination

While Fabric Warehouse is based on SQL Server, there are key differences:

1. **Authentication**: Fabric requires Service Principal; username/password auth is not supported
2. **Type System**: Uses `varchar` and `datetime2` instead of `nvarchar` and `datetimeoffset`
3. **Collation**: Optimized for UTF-8 collations
4. **SQL Dialect**: Uses `fabric` SQLglot dialect for proper SQL generation

### dbt support
Integration with [dbt](../transformations/dbt/dbt.md) is supported via [dbt-fabric](https://github.com/Microsoft/dbt-fabric). Both Service Principal and default Azure credentials are supported and shared with dbt runners.

## Troubleshooting

### Driver installation

Ensure `dlt[fabric]` and the platform-specific system libraries required by `mssql-python` are installed. SQLAlchemy and dbt integrations may still require their own ODBC installation.

### Authentication Failures

Ensure your Service Principal has:
- Proper permissions on the Fabric workspace
- Access to the target database/warehouse  
- Correct tenant ID (your Azure AD tenant, not the workspace/capacity ID)

### UTF-8 Character Issues

If you experience character encoding issues:
1. Verify your warehouse uses a UTF-8 collation
2. Use a supported `mssql-python` version; do not add `LongAsMax` to its connection string
3. Consider using the case-insensitive UTF-8 collation if needed
